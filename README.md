# N_queen
In this project done in 2022 during my Engineering Physics degree, I've tried to solve the N Queen problem.
The goal is to solve the N-Queens problem, which involves taking an NxN chessboard with N ∈ ℕ, and finding the configuration of queens such that the queens do not attack each other. Given a value N, the algorithm finds an arrangement in which these conditions are satisfied.

To solve the problem, the following algorithms are used:
Constraint propagation and backtracking, 
Simulated Annealing, 
Genetic algorithms,
